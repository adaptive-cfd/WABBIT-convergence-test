# 1. Running scripts:
  - the main files of this study are contained in:
    01_synthetic_test_case.py   ... synthetic test case of oscillating bumps
    02_vortex_street.py         ... von Karmans vortex street at Re=200
    03_bumblebee.py             ... adaptive calculation of a bumblebee
  - before you run the scripts make sure that you have set all parameters in
    wPODdirs.py
  - a current version of wabbit should be installed on your pc and ready to go

# 2. Theoretical results are contained in the directory theory/. 
     Here you find calculation of the CDF4,0 coefficients
     and the computation of the autocorrelation function between two scaling functions.

# 3. All functions and scripts are contained in the package folder wPOD
